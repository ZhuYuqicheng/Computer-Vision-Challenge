README - Computer Vision Group 6

Requirements: 

- MATLAB version >= R2020b (MATLAB R2019b won't work!)
- Toolbox:

1. To use our program, just open "main.m" and run. (Please make sure that your current MATLAB path is correct.)

2. You can find a "Select Directory" button on the top left of the user interface, klick it you can select the directory of your datasets

3. Notice that in the directory you select, it must contain different datasets folders which have pictures in it.

4. The format of the pictures must be "YEAR_MONTH.jpg" (as required in challenge document)

5. Notice that do not change the name of the default datasets (like "Dubai").

6. For your own datasets, time lapse function just allows 8 pictures. If you have more than 8 pictures, it will just visualize the first 8 pictures; 
   if you have less than 8 pictures, the last one will be repeated in time lapse.

7. For the initialization, some datasets ("Brazilian Rainforest", "Wiesn") could take a while (depending on your device). Better to start with "Dubai" and "Kuwait".

Hope you enjoy! :)
